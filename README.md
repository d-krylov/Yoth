There are many linear algebra libraries available. However, I have not found in the network such libraries where 
besides vectors there were classes of points and normals, with behaviour characteristic for these types of objects.
Apart from the implementation in [pbrt](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4). My code is based on the code from pbrt with 
some modifications under C++ 20 and additional tools. I made it for my experiments in PBR.
